# Facial-Expression-Recognition
Emotions are expressed when interacting and communicating with others. Studying how to read them can be a daunting task, so technology is used to make that work. Emotion recognition is used by many organizations today, but what exactly is it?
Emotion recognition is one of many facial recognition technologies that have evolved and grown over the years. Currently, facial emotion recognition software is used to allow a certain program to examine and process human facial expressions. Using advanced image distribution, the software works like the human brain, giving it the ability to recognize emotions.
It's AI or "Artificial Intelligence" that detects and studies different facial expressions to use them with additional information provided to them. This is useful for a variety of purposes, including investigations and interviews, and allows authorities to detect a person's emotions using technology alone.
